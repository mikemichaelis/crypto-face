I would like to create an Angular spa which will serve as the front end for gekko.

Who would I target?

How can I make it feel safe to use?

How will I profit?

I will make it a beatiful, intituive, and powerful UX.

It will walk the user through the process of creating a wallet and the initial purchase of cryptocurrency.

It will walk the user through extracting the required configuration.

It will provide for free a single local execution with no remote access.  Limitations:
    1. !Docker
    2. !Remote access to UI
        a. It would be possible to subvert and access the container remotely but not acomplished easily
            i. By default only allow access from local IP.  -Not possible

Dont make this free, make it a SasS or SaaP type account with a limite free tier.  Make no source
available.  Customi
